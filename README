PlayerNotes is a simple plugin for Bukkit that allows moderators to
keep track of the players on their server. Someone caught griefing?
Make a note of it. Someone got promoted for good behaviour? Make a
note of it. Other mods can then check the notes on a given player
to see what they've been up to, in order to better determine the
appropriate course of action.

== Commands ==
    * /n <playername> <note>
        Write down a note about <playername>
    * /notes <playername> [page]
        See the notes about a player, with optional page number
    * /n <id>
        Delete a note with a given ID #. The ID # of a note is found
        in the brackets at the end of each note.
        
== Permissions ==
    * For /n:
        playernotes.note
    * For /notes:
        playernotes.notes
    * For /nd:
        playernotes.playernotes.notedelete
        
== Installation ==
Simply install the PlayerNotes.jar into the plugins folder, and it will
automatically install a default configuration file and database (default
uses sqlite) the first time it runs. Optionally, edit the config.yml file
to allow the plugin to use MySQL.
